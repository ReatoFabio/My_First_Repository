Adding an Update to my Readme

I'm Fabio Reato, an International Student at Columbia University. My major is Financial Economics, and my minor is Math. 
I'm a former Professional Soccer Player. I played four years in the Italian Third Division, and I retired after four knee surgeries.
I graduated from High School with the lowest score allowed, because I was totally focused on my Soccer career. 
I did not give up, and I rebuilt my Academic career step by step. 
I moved to Kansas City, Mo where I was offered a scholarship to study and Coach the Rockhurst University Men's Soccer Team.
